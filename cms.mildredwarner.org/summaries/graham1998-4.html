<div class="summary_content">
  <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; mso-fareast-font-family: Times New Roman; mso-ansi-language: EN-US; mso-fareast-language: EN-US; mso-bidi-language: AR-SA"><b>Chapter         4: The Capitalization and Popular Participation Programs in Bolivia</b></span></p>         <p class="MsoNormal"><b><font size="3">Introduction</font></b><i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal"><b><o:p>         </b>         </o:p>         </i></p>         <p style="text-indent:.5in">The capitalization and         Popular Participation programs in Bolivia addressed inefficiencies in         the government. The highly centralized system could not adequately meet         local needs or address major social problems such as a 60% poverty rate.         Bolivia privatized its government-owned industries to increase         productivity and capital investment. It reformed its social security         system, rescuing it from bankruptcy and expanding it to cover most of         the population. It also decentralized functions to local government and         greatly enhanced citizen political participation.</p>         <p><b>Capitalization</b></p>         <p>         The capitalization program (1993) had three objectives- privatization,         social security reform, and creating more stakeholders in the program.         The program was designed to attract foreign investment in Bolivia         without giving up ownership.</p>         <p> Bolivia did not have the         money to invest in its own industries and foreign investment was the         solution, increasing economic growth by 6-8% per year. When the         government privatized its businesses, it required the foreign investors         to buy half of the shares of the company by investing that amount of         money in Bolivia instead of paying the government for the shares.</p>         <p style="text-indent:.5in">The government invested         the other half of the shares in the new social security program. The old         social security program was almost bankrupt and only covered 11% of the         workforce. The new system covers more employees and allows workers to         retire upon accumulating a pension based on 70% of their average salary.         Upon retirement, a person buys an annuity to pay out his benefits and         there is no guaranteed minimum benefit. The new pension system increased         national savings from 2% of GDP to 5% of GDP.</p>         <p style="text-indent:.5in">The public could         purchase government-issued shares in privatization at book value with         only 5% down. Many people who could not ordinarily afford to purchase         shares were able to because the shares were sold at book value (cheaper         than the market price) and only a small downpayment was required. These         shareholders were directly involved in privatization, creating         widespread public support for the program. The poorest people could not         afford shares, which increased inequality.</p>         <p style="text-indent:.5in">The dividends from the         shares, called bonosols, were invested to pay $200 per year to all         Bolivians 65 and older. This measure helped poor Bolivians and increased         equality among the elderly.</center><i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal"><o:p></i></p>       <div align="center">         <center>         <table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%">           <tr>             <td width="100%"><b>Popular       Participation</b></td>           </tr>         </table>         </center>       </div>   <p style="text-indent:0in" align="left"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt">   The Popular Participation program (1994)   decentralized the government and devolved responsibility and resources to the   local level. The changes resulted in the creation of 250 new municipalities   and recognition of 19,000 community and grassroots organizations, compared to   100 before the program, that could oversee and help direct local resource use.   <o:p>   </o:p>   </span></p>   <p style="text-indent:.5in" align="left"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt">The local governments received a larger proportion of   tax revenues for their new responsibilities and community groups had a voice   in what investments they would like the government to make. These groups   helped to create a municipal development plan (PDM) to coordinate local   interests with investments. Then, the mayor, municipal council, and vigilance   committee look at the PDM and formulate an annual operating plan. The plan is   then examined by the vigilance committees and the Finance Ministry for   approval.<o:p>   </o:p>   </span></p>   <p style="text-indent:.5in" align="left"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt">Vigilance committees (VCs) were formed to supervise   the spending of funds and ensure accountability. They could get Congress to   freeze local funds if they were misused. This program created a huge change in   the way the country was run. Instead of top-down dictation of projects,   communities could design their own projects and only had to get the central   government to approve the financing, which was just a technicality. <o:p>   </o:p>   </span></p>   <p style="text-indent:.5in" align="left"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt">The program also reformed education, allowing more   local control in financing schools, evaluating teachers, textbooks, and   curriculum. More control needs to be devolved in the school system, such as   hiring and firing control.<o:p>   </span>   <center>   <span style="font-size:12.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt"><o:p>   </span></center><b>Conclusion</b></p>   <p style="text-indent:.5in" align="left"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt">Bolivia is an interesting case because it was   successful. The reforms resulted in increased investment, productivity   improvements, and citizen participation despite the extreme poverty of the   country. The reforms could have gone further by giving the citizens a voice   that carries more weight and by devolving more power to the local government   over the school system. VC members are not paid and they do not have   significant resources. Some mayors have tried to influence VC members through   bribes or threats, and some VCs are not truly representative because the mayor   ordered their formation. Despite shortcomings in the reforms, other countries   used Bolivia as a role model in implementing their own reforms.<o:p>   </o:p>   </span></p>   <center>         <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.5in"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt">         </o:p>         </span></p>         <p></center>
