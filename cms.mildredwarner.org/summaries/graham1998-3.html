The semi-public         institution reforms were also politically feasible for the Peruvian         government because they had little political opposition due to the small         numbers the institutions served.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>It         is important to note that while these programs achieved the most         success, they did not serve extremely poor Peruvians.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>Major reform efforts of main line ministries, such as         education and healthcare, did not succeed because they serve the         majority of the population and provide social welfare benefits, as         opposed to direct financial benefits.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">         </span>As a result, these reforms conjured up a large amount of         political opposition and Presidential support evaporated.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">         </span>The contrasting experiences of the three reform efforts reveal         that reforms in semi-public institutions are easier to implement but         cannot substitute for reforms of public institutions that offer basic         services to the majority of the population, including the poor.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">         </span>It is the latter reforms that are crucial to the longer-term         sustainability of market-led growth and will improve the capacity of the         poor to participate in growth as stakeholders.</p>         <p class="MsoNormal"><a name="Appendix_A"></a><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal">Education:</b><span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>Fugimori         backed away from any proposals dealing with the privatization or         decentralization of education after his proposed comprehensive reform of         the education system almost cost him the October 1993 referendum.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">         </span>The reform was based on Chiles municipal administration policy         and voucher-based subsidizing of both public and private schools. (See         Chile).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>Since then,         progress in education reform in Peru has been limited to infrastructure         improvements.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"></span></p>         <p class="MsoNormal"><a name="Appendix_B"></a><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal">Healthcare:</b><span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>Reform of         healthcare was implemented at the local level through Committees for         Local Social Administration (CLAS), which were given legal and financial         responsibility for administering the health posts in their jurisdiction.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">         </span>They were provided with public funds to pay for the personnel and         this allowed the facilities to contract with other doctors and remain         open longer hours.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>All         revenues collected from service fees are kept in the CLAS rather than         sent to regional authorities.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>Their         success reveals the vitality of community initiative in Peru and the         strong potential for creating local-level stakeholders in reform.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">         </span>A drawback is that CLASs influence is limited to the local         level because it has no point of entry into the larger public health         system.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>It also has not         reached the poorest of the population.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"></span></p>         <p class="MsoNormal"><a name="Appendix_C"></a><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal">Social Security:</b><span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>Both         pension reform and privatization of state owned enterprises increased         the number of stakeholders in the reforms, encouraged savings and         investment, and provided valuable experience with participation in newly         emerging capital markets. Ultimately, these actions contributed to the         political sustainability of reform.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">         </span>The pension program (based on private alternatives) was largely         successful because the President supported it and because it covered         only 2 million workers (1 million who stayed with the public plan and 1         million who switched to the private plan).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">         </span>Because the pension program only covered a small part of the         total work force, rather than an entire population, opposition was         limited to weak labor unions.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>As         a result, reform was politically feasible.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>The public plan was pay as you go while the new plan         administered individual accounts based on investment.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>It offered no minimum and the contribution rates were higher         which resulted in younger and richer people switching to the new plan.         Advantages of the new plan were having life insurance, being able to         contribute to ones own retirement, and being able to retire earlier         than the official age.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>Those         who stayed with the public plan did so mainly because of lack of         experience with savings and/or lack of access to information.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">         </span>The new plan was reasonably successful in attracting workers from         one forced saving plan to another, but 70% of the work force in the         informal sector remains outside either system.</p>         <p class="MsoNormal"><a name="Appendix_D"></a><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal">Privatization of State-owned Enterprises:</b><span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>Similar to the pension reform program, the Citizen         Participation Program, designed to encourage participation in share         buying of state owned enterprises, received immense support from the         President.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>Executive         commitment provided sufficient resources to attract a good technical         team for the Citizen Participation Program and the President provided         important publicity for the program.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">         </span>The program was designed to reach lower-income investors by         pricing the shares inexpensively.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>The         minimum purchase was 515 soles, or US $234, and the maximum was 3,090         soles, or US $1404.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>An aggressive marketing campaign targeted low-income         investors, especially in provinces outside of Lima. Over half a million         investors participated in the Citizen Participation Program which made         the reform more politically sustainable.
