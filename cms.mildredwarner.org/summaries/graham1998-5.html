Czech banks,         which owned over half of these investment funds, were inclined to         provide open lines of credit and, in turn, exert a considerable amount         of control over enterprise shares and implicitly support potentially         risky acquisitions on the part of the funds.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">         </span>The funds, which were restricted from purchasing more than 20% of         shares on any enterprise, were prevented from having a majority stake in         privatization, and therefore were little concerned with the         responsibility of ownership, corporate restructuring, and managerial         reform.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>This became a huge         liability for the long term success of privatization, as foreign         investors shrank from what they saw as risky acquisitions, and         consequently, the market value of voucher privatization began to         diminish.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span><o:p>         </o:p>         </span></p>         <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt"><span style="mso-tab-count: 1; mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt">         </span>The initial success of voucher privatization can be         attributed largely to the way the government was able to market the         program with an inherently egalitarian pitch.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">         </span>The majority of citizens in the Czech Republic recognized the         opportunity to make money at little cost  the price of vouchers were         cheap enough that even those in the lower income brackets could         participate.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>The degree to         which participants were to remain stakeholders, however, was linked         intrinsically to levels of wealth and education among citizens.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">         </span>Most small investors with less available resources did not         develop a sense of ownership or responsibility as a result of their         investments, and hence, gained relatively little in the long-run from         voucher privatization.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>Like         most countries experimenting with the stakeholder approach, the Czech         Republic was ultimately unsuccessful in achieving an equitable system in         which participation was even and gains were equitable.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">         </span>Most citizens lacked the means of access to truly learn and         profit from privatization, and were quickly swallowed by much stronger         and more capable forces.<o:p>         </o:p>         </span></p>         <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt"><o:p>         </span><span style="font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt">         </o:p>         </span></p>         <p></center>
