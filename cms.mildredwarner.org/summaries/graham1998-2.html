Based on private sector         participation, market-based incentives, and on new opportunities for         individual choice, Chiles public sector restructuring broadened the         base of stakeholders in a new model for delivering public goods and         services. Graham emphasizes the context for social policy reform in         Chile before examining the politics and economics of social security and         pension reform, the implementation of a voucher-based education reform,         the privatization program of popular capitalism, and the effects         of these reforms on equity. <o:p>         </o:p>         </span></p>         <p><span style="mso-spacerun: yes"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt"> Chiles extensive         social welfare system, relatively efficient public sector institutions,         and strong administrative capacity aided the implementation of the         substantial and initially, highly controversial, social service         restructuring. Adequate regulation, far-reaching dissemination of         information, an extensive stakeholder constituency, and effective         competition, all contributed to the success and political sustainability         of the market incentive approach in the Chilean social security reforms.</span></p>         <p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt">         While in         general, Graham finds that new market incentives and increased         competition improved the performance of <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">both</i>         public and private sector institutions, she nevertheless maintains that         at times it may be impossible sometimes to avoid trade-offs between         efficiency and equity improvements. Graham concedes that the most         disadvantaged people are more likely to lose out in a system with         increasing market incentives and broadening individual choice. However, the extent to which the state should correct for         inequitable market outcomes, who should be eligible for assistance, and         how much assistance they should receive is highly debatable. She raises         concerns related to equity about application of the Chilean reform model         to nations with much higher poverty and much weaker administrative         capacity than Chile. The problems with the introduction of market         incentives into the public sector were especially evident in the less         successful <span style="background-repeat: repeat; background-attachment: scroll; mso-highlight: yellow; background-position: 0%">voucher-based         education reform.</span> <u><o:p>         </o:p>         </u></span></p>         <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.25in"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt">         In the 1990s Chilean policymakers have focused on         equity reforms<i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal"> </i>because the         1970s macroeconomic reforms and the 1980s social policy reforms failed         to incorporate the poorest sector of the population as full         participants, leaving them with limited access or inferior quality         public services. However, more attention can now be focused on the lower         income groups because most of the middle and higher-income groups         receive their social services from the private sector  a result of         the privatization efforts during the 1980s. <o:p>         </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-spacerun: yes"><font size="3">         </o:p>         </font>         </span></p>         <p class="MsoBodyTextIndent2"><b><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-spacerun: yes"><font size="3">Social         Security Reforms</font></span></b></p>         <span style="font-size:12.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt">         <p class="MsoBodyTextIndent2">         </span></span><span style="mso-spacerun: yes; mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt">The Chilean         social security reform is internationally considered one of the most         highly successful efforts in the privatization of pension programs.         The reforms have five major goals: 1) Introduce uniformity into         the social security program; 2) Create better incentives for the workers         to contribute to the fund, such as individual retirement accounts; 3)         Permit workers to choose their own fund managers; 4) Use government         subsidies to help with the poorest workers; and 5) Introduce efficiency         through competition between different fund managers.<span style="mso-tab-count: 1; mso-spacerun: yes; mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt"></span></span></p>         <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">         <p class="MsoBodyTextIndent2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-spacerun: yes"> The         pension system reforms were largely successful and politically         sustainable because of a high level of worker participation. The         increased choice within the social security system heightened         competition between pension funds and thus created incentives to improve         performance. The reforms raised the overall level of savings, avoided         taxing the young for the benefit of the old, and increased pensions for         the poorest workers. However, the new systems choice-based approach         introduced new equity problems. Less-educated, low-income workers are         more likely to make poorly informed decisions and take riskier, high         return options.</span></p>         <p class="MsoBodyTextIndent2"><b><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-spacerun: yes"><font size="3">Voucher-Based         Education Reform</font></span></b></p>         </span>         <p class="MsoBodyTextIndent2">         <span style="mso-spacerun: yes; mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt">The educational reforms gave people the right to         choose public or private school education by issuing         government-subsidized vouchers. Private         schools could receive government subsidies in exchange for relinquishing         the right to charge fees. In alignment with the reforms aim to         generate competition between public and private schools, allocation of         state funding was shifted to a per-pupil basis for both public and         private institutions. The         reforms reduced the size and power of the Education Ministry and         transferred the responsibility for management of primary and secondary         schools to municipalities. Two implicit objectives of the reforms were:         1) To diminish the power of the teachers union; and 2) transfer         resources from higher education to basic education, thus benefiting         lower-income groups.</span><span style="mso-spacerun: yes"><o:p></span></p>         <p class="MsoBodyTextIndent2"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes; font-size: 12.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt"></span><span style="mso-spacerun: yes; mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt">         <span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-spacerun: yes">Although private schools are still associated         with a better quality of education, the introduction of competition did         generally encourage the public schools to improve performance. In spite of this trend, the education reforms were largely         ineffective in the effort to benefit low-income groups. Even though all         the participants were offered new choices and opportunities, the         participation of the poor was often precluded by the lack of adequate         information, logistical access, and admissions selection processes to         private or improved public schools. Since the private schools could be         more selective about the students they chose to admit, they tended to         accept wealthier children. Moreover,         key actors such as rural communities, parents, and teachers were not         properly consulted nor incorporated into the model. For instance under         the reforms, almost 10,000 teachers were dismissed when they lost their         status as civil servants. Indeed the teachers unions opposition         considerably hindered the effectiveness of the stakeholder-based         reforms, thus demonstrating how the political priorities of the         government can sometimes undermine policy reforms. <o:p>         </span></span><span style="mso-spacerun: yes; font-size: 12.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt"><span style="font-size:12.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt">         </o:p>         </span></p>         <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt"><o:p>         </o:p>         </span></p>         <p></span>
