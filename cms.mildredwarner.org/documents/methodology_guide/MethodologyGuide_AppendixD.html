<h1>Appendix D: National surveys on early care and education</h1>
<h3>from<i> Measuring the Regional Importance of Early Care and Education: The Cornell 
Methodology Guide</i>, by Rosaria Ribeiro and Mildred Warner, Ph.D.</h3>
<p>A number of national surveys provide data on child care. These surveys are excellent 
and often have sample sizes large enough to provide reliable estimates at the state 
level. Descriptions of some of these surveys are provided below: questions asked, 
geographic coverage, etc. These surveys provide estimates of children served by 
non-parental care but estimates may not be available for smaller geographies such 
as the state or county level. In such cases, study teams should use state and local 
administrative data and only use national data for comparison purposes. </p>
<p>Four major national surveys are described here. One of the surveys is conducted 
by the <i>US Census Bureau</i>—the Survey of Income and Program Participation (SIPP)—and 
is the basis for the Current Population Reports, “Who is Minding the Kids.” The
<i>Bureau of Labor Statistics</i> conducts another survey—Current Population Survey 
(CPS)— that is used to estimate number of children in paid care at the state level. 
Another survey is the National Survey of America&#39;s Families (NSAF) conducted for 
the <i>Urban Institute and Child Trends</i> by Westat, a nationally renowned survey 
research firm. The <i>National Center for Education Statistics</i> also conducts 
a survey on early education and after school programs— the National Household Education 
Survey (NHES)—that includes data on child care arrangements. </p>
<p><b>US CENSUS BUREAU SURVEY OF INCOME AND PROGRAM PARTICIPATION (SIPP)</b> collects 
data on income, labor force information, program participation and eligibility data, 
as well as general demographics. The survey sample was expanded in 1996 to include 
over 37,000 households. The Child Care Topical Module includes several questions 
regarding child care, including: child care arrangements by type of care, hours 
per week spent in non-parental care, number of child care arrangements used per 
week, and weekly amount paid for care, including the amount paid to relatives such 
as a grandparent. </p>
<p>Based on the SIPP child care data, the US Census Bureau developed the <i>Current 
Population Reports: Who’s Minding the Kids?</i> This report provides a national 
and regional estimate of child care arrangements and family characteristics. This 
report is available every two years and the last year available is Spring 1999. 
The data are available for preschoolers (children under 5 years old) and for school-age 
care (children between 5 and 14 years of age). Table D1 shows the child care arrangements 
used by employed mothers of preschoolers in 1995 and 1999 based on the SIPP survey.

<p><b>CURRENT POPULATION SURVEY ANNUAL DEMOGRAPHIC SUPPLEMENT (CPS) (MARCH SUPPLEMENT)
</b>collects data concerning work experience, multiple sources of income, migration, 
household composition, health insurance coverage, and receipt of non-cash benefits. 
Beginning in the year 2001, the survey also included three questions on child care. 
The Current Population Survey (CPS) (March Supplement) samples about 218,000 individuals. 
The sample provides national aggregate estimates and serves as part of model-based 
estimates for individual states and other geographic areas, so this data would be 
fine for state level analysis of child care arrangements. The US Census Bureau recommends 
using a three-year rolling average to get an estimate for individual states. The 
data are available at: <a href="http://www.bls.census.gov/cps">www.bls.census.gov/cps</a>&nbsp;

<p><b>NATIONAL SURVEY OF AMERICA&#39;S FAMILIES (NSAF)</b> is conducted for the Urban 
Institute and Child Trends by Westat, a survey research firm. The survey data are 
drawn to represent national, as well as, state data on the non-institutionalized, 
civilian population of persons under age 65. Thirteen states are included: Alabama, 
California, Colorado, Florida, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Mississippi, 
New Jersey, New York, Texas, Washington, and Wisconsin. The survey sample includes 
over 42,000 households. The survey incorporates measures of child well-being, including 
child care arrangements. The questions on child care include <i>arrangements by type 
of care, hours per week spent in non-parental care, number of child care arrangements 
used, monthly and weekly amount paid for care, and others</i>. Table D2 illustrates 
results from the 1999 National Survey of American Families. The data are available

<p><b>NATIONAL HOUSEHOLD EDUCATION SURVEY (NHES)</b> is conducted by the National 
Center for Education Statistics (NCES) and examines the arrangements of children 
who receive care from persons other than their parents, regardless of parental activities 
while in care or educational settings. The survey is available every two-years and 
the most recent data available are for the year 2001. The early education survey 
(ECPP-NHES: 2001) includes interview data completed with parents of 6,749 children, 
of whom 3,599 were infants or toddlers, and of whom 3,150 were preschoolers. The 
school-age care survey (ASPA-NHES: 2001) contains interview data completed with 
parents of 9,583 children in kindergarten through 8th grade, including 9,388 students 
enrolled in regular public or private schools and 195 home-schooled children. These 
data are only available at the national level. The URL for the NHES is:
