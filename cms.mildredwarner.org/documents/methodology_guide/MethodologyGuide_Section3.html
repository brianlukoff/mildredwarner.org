<h1>Section 3: Measuring the size of the child care sector</h1>
<h3>from<i> Measuring the Regional Importance of Early Care and Education: The Cornell 
Methodology Guide</i>, by Rosaria Ribeiro and Mildred Warner, Ph.D.</h3>
<p>The child care industry represents a large and growing economic sector. In New 
York State, the child care sector was found to include 22,000 regulated establishments, 
employing 119,000 workers, serving 623,000 children and bringing in almost $4.7 
billion in gross receipts annually.</p>
<p>Measuring the size of the child care sector: number of businesses (establishments), 
number of employees, product (children served) and sales (gross receipts)—is the 
first order of business in an economic analysis. This is the most important and 
time consuming part of the economic analysis. </p>
<table class="callout" cellpadding="10">
  <tr>
    <td>Size of the Child Care Sector:
    <ul>
      <li>Number of Establishments </li>
      <li>Number of Employees </li>

      <li>Gross Receipts </li>
    </ul>
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>
<p>In this section, we provide examples of the methods used to collect data and 
measure the size of the child care sector. </p>
<h2>COLLECTING ECONOMIC DATA FOR CHILD CARE</h2>
<p>
    <img border="0" src="../../../www.mildredwarner.org/images/arrow.html" width="15" height="15">&nbsp;
    <a name="BasicEconomicDataOnChildCareSector" href="../../../www.mildredwarner.org/documents/excel/BasicEconomicDataOnChildCareSector.html">Basic economic 
    data on child care sector worksheet</a> (requires Microsoft Excel)</p>
<p>The child care sector includes for-profit, non-profit, and publicly funded establishments. 
There also are a large number of self-employed providers who may not be registered 
or licensed, and who are even harder to enumerate. In addition, some child care 
establishments are attributed to other sectors, including social services and education.</p>
<img src="../../../www.mildredwarner.org/documents/methodology_guide/MethodologyGuide_Section3_Figure0.html" class="figure" width="301" height="194">
<p>Different data sources capture different aspects of the sector and it is difficult 
to match the data from one source to another. Unfortunately, there is no single 
data source available that provides data on all types of care. Deciding which data 
sources to use and what portion of the sector to count (part and full-time, licensed, 
licensed-exempt, etc.) is a policy choice that research teams have to make collectively.
</p>
<p>We recommend that researchers use sources that capture the majority of the child 
care providers in the area being studied. Study teams who conduct child care economic 
analyses typically end the process with a new appreciation for the importance of 
comprehensive data and a renewed commitment to more integrated child care data systems.</p>
<h3>State and Local Administrative Data</h3>
<p>Most studies use licensing data from their state agencies and compare it to Child 
Care Resource &amp; Referral network (CCR&amp;R) data. State licensing data provide the 
number of licensed establishments, the legal capacity of children by age group, 
and staffing ratios that can be used to estimate employment. State market rate surveys 
are a source of data for the price of child care by type of provider, age group, 
location and, in some cases, actual enrollment. One advantage of state administrative 
data is the consistency in method of collection across establishments, employees, 
children served, and price of care. State administrative sources also can be used 
to calculate the amount of government investment in the child care industry. CCR&amp;R 
data can confirm and enrich state data, and may provide local vacancy rates and 
average prices. CCR&amp;R data often include larger numbers of family providers and 
license-exempt programs.<a href="#Footnote1"><sup>1</sup></a> Some study teams have 
conducted surveys or used an existing survey from another source to add to the available 
data. </p>
<h3>National Economic Data</h3>
<p>National economic data sources such as the County Business Patterns, Economic 
Census, US Census Nonemployer Statistics, and Bureau of Labor Statistics report 
on certain aspects of the child care sector and can be used for a comparison with 
state and local administrative data. Most national economic data are available in 
two main categories: employer and non-employer (e.g. self-employed) establishments. 
When comparing state administrative data to national economic data on child care, 
study teams should pay close attention to the definition and coverage of the sector 
by each data source (see Appendix B for detailed information on national data sources). 
Most national data sources report on the number of child care establishments, size 
of labor force, gross receipts, and employee compensation, but none report on the 
number of children served by child care providers. National data sources provide 
only the aggregate number of establishments and do not distinguish between type 
of care, or licensed and unlicensed care. </p>
<h2>MEASURING THE SIZE OF THE SECTOR</h2>
<p>Any economic sector is measured primarily by its size: total number of businesses, 
number of workers, product, and revenue. For the child care sector, this includes: 
number of child care establishments, size of the child care labor force, number 
of children served by paid care, and total gross receipts of the sector. Following 
is a detailed description of the methods used to measure the size of the child care 
sector. </p>
<h3>I. Number of Establishments</h3>
<p>The child care sector is composed of a large number of small businesses. The 
number of establishments is the first piece of data to collect and forms the basis 
for calculating many of the other measures. Most studies base the number of establishments 
on state licensing data. This typically includes centers, family and group family 
care homes, and registered after-school programs. </p>
<table class="callout" cellpadding="10">
  <tr>
    <td>New York State: <b>22,000</b> regulated child care establishments <br>
    Kansas State: <b>8,650</b> licensed child care establishments </td>
  </tr>
</table>
<p>Some government funded programs such as Head Start and pre-kindergarten are included 
in the licensing data and some might be license-exempt, depending on the regulations 
in each state. Knowing how the sector is structured is critical in order to avoid 
double counting or under counting the sector. </p>
<p>What to include in the count of establishments will depend on each state. For 
example, in Kansas publicly funded pre-kindergarten is totally within the public 
school system, so the study team decided not to include it in the total number of 
child care establishments, because it does not involve the private sector. By contrast, 
in New York State pre-kindergarten is funded both in private child care and public 
school settings. The New York team decided to include a complete count of all publicly 
funded pre-kindergarten, and thus added pre-kindergarten in public schools to the 
totals because it is regulated by the Department of Education and not already counted 
in the licensing data. </p>
<p>Some part-time programs may be license-exempt (nursery schools, summer camps) 
and not captured in the licensing data. Unless an alternative administrative record 
can be found that tracks these providers, they are generally left out of the analysis. 
At the local level, if CCR&amp;Rs collect data on these providers, they can be added 
to the study. In Tompkins County, the CCR&amp;R had data on nursery schools and other 
part-time programs so these were included in the count of establishments. </p>
<table class="callout" cellpadding="10" width="30%">
  <tr>
    <td>Types of Early Care and Education Establishments:
    <ul>
      <li>Center care </li>
      <li>Group family home providers </li>
      <li>Family home providers </li>
      <li>License-exempt family providers </li>
      <li>Part-time care and education (after school care, pre- school) </li>
      <li>Summer camp </li>
      <li>Head Start in both private and public settings </li>
      <li>Publicly funded pre-kindergarten in both private and public settings
      </li>
    </ul>
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>
<p>For accuracy, studies should count all that it is possible to estimate accurately 
but should not add those portions that cannot be substantiated. For this reason, 
most studies do not attempt to count informal family, friend, and neighbor care. 
However, this can be a substantial part of the sector and the US Census Bureau Nonemployer 
data can give a rough estimate of the informal providers in the area being studied 
(see Appendix B).<a href="#Footnote2"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
<p>Most states have good administrative data on that portion of license-exempt providers 
approved to provide care for children receiving child care subsidies. The New York 
report counted the number of children served by license-exempt providers providing 
subsidy care, but did not include these providers in the total number of establishments. 
By contrast, the Tompkins County report included licensed-exempt providers who registered 
with the CCR&amp;R. Tompkins County was able to include a more comprehensive count of 
providers because the local CCR&amp;R had conducted an extensive survey of the child 
care sector in 2001. </p>

<p>National economic data on the number of establishments can be used to compare 
and triangulate with the data from state licensing agencies and CCR&amp;Rs. National 
sources for the number of employer establishments are primarily the Economic Census 
and the County Business Patterns. The data from these two sources can be added to 
the Nonemployer (self-employed providers) data series from the US Census Bureau 
to get an estimate of the total number of non-school-based child care establishments 
in the area studied (see Appendix B). </p>
<table class="callout" cellpadding="10" style="float:left;">
  <tr>
    <td>
    <h3>Child Care Resource and Referral Agencies: <br>
    Intermediary Services for Parents and Providers</h3>
    <p>In any economic sector, intermediaries connect consumers to producers and 
    strengthen industry linkages between producers themselves. Child Care Resource 
    and Referral (CCR&amp;R) agencies play such a role in the child care sector, providing 
    an essential infrastructure for child care providers and consumers. CCR&amp;R agencies 
    help assess community need, provide referral services, develop supply, and help 
    families make informed child care choices. CCR&amp;Rs also play an important intermediary 
    role for providers. For example, they may serve as sponsors for the US Department 
    of Agriculture Child and Adult Care Food Program (CACFP), thereby enabling home-based 
    providers to access these federal funds. Many CCR&amp;Rs train providers in child 
    development, health and safety, and in business management.</p>
    <p>The revenue and jobs generated by CCR&amp;R agencies could be considered part 
    of the child care industry, although to date no state or local study has included 
    them in the estimate of the sector. In New York State, for example, the network 
    of CCR&amp;Rs covers every county and New York City. The 42 CCR&amp;Rs have aggregate 
    budgets that total $77.6 million in 2002 (Warner et. al, 2003).</p>
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>
<p>Table 1 illustrates how regulated care as a share of total establishments is 
extremely different for New York and Kansas. In New York, a large portion of the 
child care sector is in the self-employed sector and not counted in the licensing 
data. By contrast, Kansas licensed data captures more providers that are self-employed.</p>
<img src="../../../www.mildredwarner.org/documents/methodology_guide/MethodologyGuide_Section3_Figure1.html" class="figure" width="640" height="451">
<h4>Understanding the Structure of the Child Care Market</h4>
<p>Study teams should pay attention to the sector’s structure. It is important to 
know what type of provider is dominant in your region in order to elaborate an effective 
policy that will reach the largest number of providers and children served. As Figure 
1, from the New York report shows, it is often the case that the majority of providers 
are home-based small businesses, but the majority of children are served in center-based 
care. While 66 percent of establishments are home based, only 32 percent of the 
regulated child care capacity is home-based. Thus, policies to address the needs 
of providers may differ from policies designed to reach the majority of children 
served.</p>
<h3>II. Child Care Labor Force</h3>
<table class="callout" cellpadding="10">
  <tr>
    <td>Child care employs:
    <ul>
      <li>New York State: <b>119,000</b> workers</li>
      <li>Kansas State: <b>14,370 </b>workers</li>
    </ul>
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>
<p>The number of employees is a critical measure of the size of the child care sector. 
Most studies use staffing ratios by type of care and age of children to estimate 
employment. </p>
<p>The general formula counts: one employee per family provider, 1.5 - 2 employees 
per group family provider, and the actual staffing ratio by children’s age group 
distribution in centers. This formula will vary by state based on licensing regulations. 
The employment estimates using staffing ratios are based on licensing data and include 
only the regulated (license and license-exempt) child care sector.</p>
<h4>Counting Support Staff </h4>
<p>Some studies add staff for administrative support in centers, if the data are 
available. For instance, the New York study team used data from the Child Care Professional 
Retention Program (to estimate support and administrative staff for each center 
teacher). The New York report also used data from the Department of Education to 
estimate pre-kindergarten employment (not included in licensing data). Studies conducted 
by the National Economic Development Law Center (NEDLC) estimated the number of 
administrative and support staff based on a “typical” center. California assumed 
that each center employs a custodian, a cook, and an administrative assistant for 
every 80 children or more enrolled (Hildebrand and Upp, 2001a). </p>
<p>Some studies adjusted the employment data to account for the length of operating 
hours in most centers (over 8 hours). The New York study assumed that most centers 
stay open from 7 am to 6 pm, so there is an additional 0.38 FTE for every full time 
employee. Maine’s study used a similar method based on average hours per week that 
full-time and part-time facilities were open.</p>
<table class="callout" cellpadding="10" width="30%">
  <tr>
    <td>Estimating the Child Care Workforce:<ul>
      <li>One employee per family provider</li>
      <li>1.5 to 2 employees per group family provider</li>
      <li>Actual staffing ratio by children’s age group distribution in centers</li>
      <li>Administrative support staff for centers, if data are available</li>
      <li>License-exempt providers, if data are available (such as family providers 
      and public schools)</li>
    </ul>
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>
<h5>State Survey Data </h5>
<p>Other studies used survey data to estimate the number of employees in the child 
care sector. The Vermont report used data from a regional survey of child care providers 
to estimate licensed center and registered family care employment. Vermont’s employment 
estimate also includes administrative and support staff. In Vermont, the survey 
response rate was about 72 percent and researchers assumed the profile of the centers 
and family care providers that did not respond was similar to those that did. Maine 
also used survey data to measure employment. The number of child care employees 
was obtained from the State of Maine Child Care 2002 Market Rate Survey. This data 
was extrapolated to the state level based on data on licensed caregivers provided 
by Maine’s Department of Human Services.</p>
<h5>National Data Sources</h5>
<p>National data sources also can be used to estimate the size of the child care 
labor force, but these sources only offer an aggregate number, which includes employees 
in both licensed and unlicensed facilities. As with the number of establishments, 
data on employment is available from the Economic Census, County Business Patterns, 
the US Census Nonemployer Statistics, and the Bureau of Labor Statistics. The Nonemployer 
data series (self-employed providers) from the US Census Bureau can be added to 
the employee data from the Economic Census or the County Business Patterns to get 
an alternate estimate of the total number of employees in the child care sector. 
As Table 2 shows, the comparison between national and administrative data on employment 
varies between Kansas and New York. </p>
<p>The Human Services and Policy Center (HSPC) at the University of Washington has 
compiled a catalog of state data sources to measure the size of the child care labor 
force (Breuning et al, 2003). HSPC is also working in collaboration with the Center 
for Child Care Workforce to develop a framework and methodology for measuring the 
U.S. child care workforce more accurately than is presently done. </p>
<p>Total employment can be used to compare the size of the child care sector to 
other local industries. Figure 2, from the Kansas report, shows a comparison between 
child care employment and other important industries in Kansas. Data on employment 
in other industries is available from the Economic Census, the County Business Patterns, 
Bureau of Labor Statistics, and economic modeling programs such as IMPLAN.<a href="#Footnote3"><sup>3</sup></a></p>

  </tr>
</table>
<h5>Wages and Employee Turnover</h5>
<p>Some studies use wage data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics (see Appendix 
B) to compare average wages for child care workers with average wages in other service 
industries. The Florida and Vermont reports compare child care workers’ wages to 
other low paying jobs in those states. Florida’s report compares state child care 
workers’ and preschools teachers’ average wages in Florida to the national average 
for these two occupational categories. The study found that Florida wages in both 
categories are lower than the national average (Florida’s Children Forum, 2003).
</p>
<p>Some studies used staff recruitment and retention data to illustrate how low 
wages in the child care field lead to high turnover rates. Maine’s report found 
that high turnover rates force child care providers to spend more of their revenue 
re-hiring and re-training new employees, thus reducing their capacity to expand 
their programs to meet the growing demand for care. Minnesota’s report found that 
high turnover has a negative effect on the sustainability and quality of the child 
care industry.</p>
<img border="0" src="../../../www.mildredwarner.org/documents/methodology_guide/MethodologyGuide_Section3_Figure2.html" class="figure" width="564" height="336">
<h3>III. Children Served </h3>
<p>The children served by the child care industry are its product, yet comprehensive 
data on the number of children served is unavailable. The number of children served 
is needed to estimate the gross receipts of the child care sector. This data also 
can be used to estimate the demand-supply gap in the child care market.</p>
<h4>Capacity and Enrollment Estimates</h4>
<p>Most studies use licensing data to estimate the number of children served. The 
general formula used by study teams is to multiply the number of providers by the 
legal capacity of each. State licensing regulates the overall capacity for family 
and group family care, and staffing ratios of centers by age of child. Capacity 
may over count the number of children served due to vacancy rates, but it may be 
hard to get data on actual enrollment. </p>
<table class="callout" cellpadding="10">
  <tr>
    <td>Child care Serves:
    <ul>
      <li><b>623,000 </b>children in New York State</li>
      <li><b>107,000 </b>children in Kansas State</li>
    </ul>
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>
<p>In some states, the licensing agency or the CCR&amp;Rs might keep an updated database 
on enrollment. The Minnesota and Tompkins County (NY) reports used actual enrollment 
data from their state and local agencies. California, Rhode Island and Kansas adjusted 
the number of children served by the licensed capacity using vacancy rates. Vacancy 
rate estimates may be available from point-in-time surveys, such as market rate 
or CCR&amp;R surveys. New York did not have data on vacancy rates. Maine’s study team 
used the 2002 Child Care Market Rate and Workforce Study Survey enrollment results 
(children ages 0-13) and extrapolated to the state level based on Maine’s Department 
of Human Services data. </p>
<p>Some studies also included a count of some of the children served in license-exempt 
care. Children served by license-exempt providers approved to care for children 
receiving government subsidies are available from state administrative data. Some 
states have a large number of subsidy children placed in license-exempt care. According 
to the Child Care Bureau (2000), 26 percent of all US children (55 percent in some 
states) receiving subsidies are placed in license-exempt care. The Tompkins County 
study included the number of children served by license-exempt providers who “register” 
with the local CCR&amp;R. The New York State report included the number of subsidy children 
served by license-exempt providers.</p>
<p>Most studies also count the number of children served by government-funded programs, 
such as Head Start and pre-kindergarten. These programs can be found in both licensed 
and license-exempt establishments. Study teams should make sure they are not double 
counting the number of children served in licensed establishments when they add 
data on children from education-related data sources. </p>
<h4>Using National Surveys and Census Estimates</h4>
<p>Some studies used national survey data such as the National Survey of America’s 
Families to estimate number of children served by paid child care (see Appendix 
C). Such an approach assumes that each state reflects the national average. We have 
found quite a bit of variation in use of paid care across the states and recommend 
that national surveys that do not have state level estimates, be used for comparison 
purposes only. In some cases there are representative data available at the state 
level to estimate number of children served.<a href="#Footnote4"><sup>4</sup></a></p>
<p>Other studies compared the number of children served by licensed care with the 
number of children in need of care while parents work. In order to make this comparison, 
study teams use data from the US Census Bureau on the number of children living 
in families where all parents present are in the labor force (see Appendix C).<a href="#Footnote5"><sup>5</sup></a> 
For example, the Census data show that 764,721 children under age 6 are living with 
working parents in New York State, however, the estimated number of children (ages 
0-13) served in licensed care is only 623,000 children. Maine’s report shows that 
only one in four children in need of care while their parents work, is placed in 
licensed care. Some of the children not counted in New York’s and Maine’s administrative 
data are likely to be in paid care and some are in the care of non-paid relatives. 
Again, children served are the product of the child care sector. Estimating potential 
need for care (children of working parents) and actual licensed supply can provide 
an estimate of the supply - demand gap and the need for market expansion. </p>
<h3>IV. Gross Receipts </h3>
<p>
    <img border="0" src="../../../www.mildredwarner.org/images/arrow.html" width="15" height="15">&nbsp;
    <a name="RegulatedProviderFeesWorksheet" href="../../../www.mildredwarner.org/documents/excel/RegulatedProviderFeesWorksheet.html">Regulated Provider Fees Worksheet</a> (requires Microsoft Excel)</p>
<p>Gross receipts are the total revenue received by child care providers. The Kansas 
and New York studies estimated gross receipts by multiplying child care enrollment 
by price of care (accounting for type of care, child’s age and geographic location) 
and adding in direct government payments to providers. </p>
<table class="callout" cellpadding="10">
  <tr>
    <td>Gross receipts of child care:<ul>
      <li>New York State: <b>$4.7 billion</b></li>
      <li>Kansas: <b>$500 million</b></li>
    </ul>
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>
<p>It is difficult to get an accurate estimate of gross receipts. National studies 
consistently find consumer expenditure survey estimates to be lower than provider 
based engineering estimates (Smith, 2002; Giannarelli, 2000). We recommend using 
engineering estimates based on provider enrollment and fees because that links most 
directly to the source for data on establishments, labor and children served and 
thus provides internal consistency to the report. However, such engineering estimates 
may overstate revenues to the extent there is a vacancy rate, part time children 
using only half of a full day slot, or weeks when a slot is empty due to child turnover.
</p>
<h4>Provider Fees</h4>
<p>The formula used by most studies to estimate provider fees is: the total licensed

<p>In the Kansas and New York studies, the average price of care was calculated 
by multiplying weekly charges (by age group and type of care), times the number 
of weeks in care. Our method assumed that for all categories except school age child 
care, children are in care 52 weeks a year. School-age child care weekly charges 
were multiplied by 40 weeks, and summer care costs were multiplied by 12 weeks.<a href="#Footnote6"><sup>6</sup></a> 
Table 3 shows how the New York Study team estimated provider fees. Other studies 
have used similar techniques but used different assumptions for number of weeks 
and price of care. These are choices study teams will have to make. </p>
<p>In the Kansas and New York State reports conducted by Cornell, we compared the 
IMPLAN gross receipts estimates, which are based on the US Bureau of Labor Statistics 
Consumer Expenditure Survey, with our project team derived estimates. The provider 
fees portion of our gross receipts estimate is the closest proxy to what IMPLAN 
measures. However, to compare to IMPLAN we subtract government subsides from provider 
fees because parents do not pay that portion. We find our estimates to be 15 to 
25 percent higher IMPLAN’s gross receipts.</p>

<h4>Government Funding</h4>
<p>The next component of gross receipts is government-funded programs that do not 
charge tuition, such as Head Start, Early Head Start and pre-kindergarten. Data 
on these programs are available from state and federal agencies. The other component 
of gross receipts is government direct payments to providers to improve quality, 
nutrition (Child and Adult Care Food Program), and staff retention. These represent 
an important source of revenue beyond provider fees. Subsidies to license-exempt 
providers can also be added because they are not already counted in the licensed 
provider fees.<a href="#Footnote7"><sup>7</sup></a> New York included these subsidies, 
but the Kansas report did not. Table 4 shows how gross receipts were estimated for 
the Kansas report.</p>

<h2>CHILD CARE IS AN IMPORTANT ECONOMIC SECTOR</h2>
<p>Measuring the size of the child care sector shows that it is an important sector 
in its own right. The New York State study found over 22,000 small businesses, employing 
119,000 workers, serving 623,000 children and generating approximately $4.7 billion 
in gross receipts. The Kansas study found the sector includes 8,650 businesses, 
14,000 workers, serves 100,000 children and generates approximately $500 million 
in gross receipts. </p>
<p>Studies supported by the Cornell team have not attempted to collect tax information 
because many child care providers are non-profit and many of the for-profit family 
providers make little profit after accounting for labor costs. Study teams should 
collect data of interest to their stakeholders. This is why it is so important to 
work with advisory committees to define the primary goals and targets of the study 
before collecting data on the sector. The Tompkins County study team was concerned 
with access and affordability of care for moderate and low-income families who work 
in the county. The Kansas study team sought to show that child care subsidies are 
an important economic investment for the state. The economic development framework 
helps focus attention on the economic contributions of the child care sector. Measuring 
the size of the sector is extremely important because it shows that child care is 
worthy of economic attention from policy makers, businesses, and economic developers.</p>
<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote1"><sup>1</sup> Both state administrative and 
CCR&amp;R data have some limitations and this varies across states. If possible, study 
teams should triangulate state licensing and CCR&amp;R data to get a better estimate 
of the size of the sector.<br>
</a><a name="Footnote2"><sup>2</sup> For example, the New York study found 14,648 
regulated family providers in the state, but the Census Nonemployer statistics for 
2001 reported 49,047 self-employed family providers who pay taxes as sole business 
proprietors. The difference between these two figures is a rough estimate of the 
number of unlicensed family providers (34,399) in New York. <br>
</a><a name="Footnote3"><sup>3</sup> The IMPLAN regional modeling program uses data 
from several sources including the Bureau of Labor Statistics, Bureau of Economic 
Analysis, and the US Census Bureau. The IMPLAN modeling software provides data for 
528 sectors of the economy including child care. <br>
</a><a name="Footnote4"><sup>4</sup> The National Survey of America’s Families has 
representative data for 13 states (see Appendix D). <br>
</a><a name="Footnote5"><sup>5</sup> This number includes children living in dual-parent 
households (both parents in labor force) and children in single parent households 
(parent in labor force).<br>
</a><a name="Footnote6"><sup>6</sup> The licensing data did not indicate differences 
in summer and school year enrollment. It is possible that some school age programs 
are closed in the summer, however, the NYS team assumed these children were still 
in some form of full-time paid care. <br>
</a><a name="Footnote7"><sup>7</sup> Subsidies for parents using licensed providers 
should not be added as they are already included in the estimate of provider fees.</p>
