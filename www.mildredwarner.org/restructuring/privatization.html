	<strong>Introduction</strong><br />
	Privatization is a worldwide phenomenon. In recent years all levels of government, seeking to reduce costs, have begun turning to the private sector to provide some of the services that are ordinarily provided by government. The spread of the privatization movement is grounded in the fundamental belief that market competition in the private sector is a more efficient way to provide these services and allows for greater citizen choice. In practice, however, concerns about service quality, social equity, and employment conditions raise skepticism of privatization. In New York State, labor concerns are also a major issue. Although empirical studies do not provide clear evidence on the costs and benefits of privatization, public perception and pressure for improved government efficiency will keep privatization on the government agenda. A review of recent literature on the theoretical and practical debates on privatization follows. A <a href="../gov-restructuring/privatization/trends.html">set of links to Professor Warner&#39;s research on national and New York State trends</a> is also available on this site.</p>

<h3 class="section-header">
	<b>Overview</b></h3>
<p>
	Most privatization research is based on case studies. The following books by E. S. Savas and Elliot Sclar lay out key theoretical and empirical arguments for and against privatization. Proponents argue that private firms are more efficient than government because of economies of scale, higher labor productivity, and fewer legal constraints. He faults government service provision for its monopoly status and inability to be responsive to citizens&#39; needs, resulting in inefficient, one-size-fits-all services. Critics argue that the nature of government services makes many of them inappropriate for privatization. They also point out that contracting may entail hidden costs, because of lack of information, the need for monitoring, and &quot;low-ball&quot; bidding. They note that in some places creating the competition necessary for effective contracting is impossible, and suggest that in practice privatization is more complicated than it seems.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;">
	Savas, E. S. 1987. <i><a href="../../cms.mildredwarner.org/summaries/savas1987.html">Privatization: The Key to Better Government</a></i>. Chatham, NJ: Chatham House. &nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 80px;">
	Savas, an advocate of privatization, describes the theory and practice of privatization and alternative service delivery arrangements, illustrating the appropriate use of various privatization techniques.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;">
	Sclar, Elliot, 2000. <i><a href="../../cms.mildredwarner.org/summaries/sclar2000.html">You Don&rsquo;t Always Get What You Pay For: The Economics of Privatization.</a></i> <city w:st="on">Ithaca</city>, <state w:st="on">NY</state>: Cornell University Press. &nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 80px; ">
	Elliot Sclar lays out and critiques the standard market-based arguments for privatization, using local government case studies. He concludes that advocates of privatization should proceed with caution.</p>
<p>
	Privatization, first propagated by Margaret Thatcher in 1970, predicted market competition would allow for greater cost-efficiency, increased consumer voice, and enable service integration in the delivery of urban services. In her article, Warner examines these promises of privatization and whether or not they are supported by empirical evidence. She concludes the article by examining the implications of privatization&rsquo;s actual results for local governance.</p>

	<b>Theory - Competition and Competition Critiques</b></h3>
<p>
	<i>Competition: The theory of privatization is fundamentally based on the notion of competition and the efficiency and choice that it engenders.</i></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px; ">
	Tiebout, Charles 1956. &quot;<a href="../../cms.mildredwarner.org/summaries/tiebout1956.html">A Pure Theory of Local Expenditures,</a>&quot; <i>Journal of Political Economy </i>64:416-424.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 80px;">
	In this classic article based on public choice theory, Charles Tiebout puts forth a model for determining the optimum expenditure level for public goods. He treats residents as consumers, who &ldquo;shop around&rdquo; for the communities that best fit their preferences. The competition among communities forces them to provide public goods at the most efficient level.</p>

Robert Bennett. Oxford: Clarendon Press. &nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 80px;">
	This article puts privatization in a theoretical context. Both decentralization and privatization reflect decentralizing trends from state to market and state to local levels of government.</p>
<p>
	<i>Competition Critiques: Competition is rarely found in markets for public goods because of the fundamental structure of such markets.</i></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px; ">
	Warner, M.E., 2003. &quot;<a href="../../cms.mildredwarner.org/summaries/warner2003.html">Competition, Cooperation and Local Governance,</a>&quot; chapter 19 pp 252-262 in&nbsp;<i>Challenges for Rural America in the Twenty First Century</i>, edited by David Brown and Louis Swanson,&nbsp;<city w:st="on"><city w:st="on">University Park</city></city>,&nbsp;<state w:st="on"><state w:st="on">PA</state></state>: Penn State University Press. &nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px; ">
	Lowery, David. 1998. &quot;<a href="../../cms.mildredwarner.org/summaries/lowery1998.html">Consumer Sovereignty and Quasi-Market Failure</a>&quot; <i>Journal of Public Administration Research and Theory</i>, pp.137-172. &nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 80px;">
	The intention of quasi-markets is to promote consumer sovereignty and efficient provision of goods and services. Lowery contends that quasi-markets often fail to meet these objectives due to 1) failure of market formation (lack of competition), 2) failure by preference error on the part of consumers and 3) failure by preference substitution (the difference between individual and collective wants). Direct government provision of goods and services, with its hierarchy and bureaucratic controls, may be needed precisely because it is less responsive to market influences.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px; ">
	Sclar, Elliot, 2000. &quot;<a href="../../cms.mildredwarner.org/summaries/sclar2000-4.html">What&rsquo;s Competition Got to Do with It? Market Structures and Public Contracting,</a>&quot; Chapter 4 of <i>You Don&rsquo;t Always Get What You Pay For: The Economics of Privatization.</i> <city w:st="on">Ithaca</city>, <state w:st="on">NY</state>: Cornell University Press. &nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 80px;">
	In this chapter, Sclar challenges the argument that privatization creates competition, and therefore efficiency, in the public sector. Due to the nature of public goods, which may be less profitable and more complicated to deliver, most public contracting has no competition (monopoly) or minimal competition among very few firms (oligopoly).</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px; ">
	Kodras, Janet. 1997. &quot;<a href="../../cms.mildredwarner.org/summaries/kodras1997.html">Restructuring the State: Devolution, Privatization, and the Geographic Redistribution of Power and Capacity in Governance.</a>&quot; pp. 79-96 in <i>State Devolution in America: Implications for a Diverse Society</i>. Ed. Lynn Staeheli, Janet Kodras, and Colin Flint. Urban Affairs Annual Reviews 48. Thousand Oaks, CA: Sage. &nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 80px;">
	Kodras outlines some of the major arguments for and against three methods of changing how government services are provided: privatization, devolution to lower levels of government, and simply abandoning service provision to the nonprofit sector.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px; ">
	Ostrom, Elinor. (2010). &quot;<a href="../../cms.mildredwarner.org/summaries/ostrom2010.html">Analyzing Collective Action.</a>&quot; <i>Agricultural Economics</i> 41(S1) (November 2010): 155&ndash;66. &nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 80px;">
	Ostrom puts forth a theoretical framework that attempts to reconcile rational choice theory with norm-based behavior regarding collective action problems.</p>
<h3 class="section-header">
	<b>Theory - Coasian Bargaining and Transaction Costs</b></h3>
<p>
	<i>Coasian bargaining creates the potential for market solutions to the provision of public goods. However it raises the issue of transactions costs which may be hard to manage.</i></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;">
	Webster, Christopher J. and Lawrence Wai-Chung Lai. 2003.&nbsp;<a href="../../cms.mildredwarner.org/summaries/websterlai2003.html"><em>Property Rights, Planning and Markets: Managing Spontaneous Cities</em></a>. Cheltenham, UK ; Northhampton , MA : Edward Elgar.</p>
<p id="yui_3_7_2_96_1375201005263_163" style="margin-left: 80px;">
	This book outlines a theory for the potential of Coasian-style bargaining to work in complex urban contexts. Agglomeration creates catallaxis (knowledge exchange) and new possibilities for spontaneous coordination that do not require government planning.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;">
	Webster, Christopher J., (1998). &quot;<a href="../../cms.mildredwarner.org/summaries/webster1998.html">Public Choice, Pigouvian and Coasian Planning Theory,</a>&quot; <i>Urban Studies</i> 35(1):53-75 &nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 80px;">
	This article contrasts Pigouvian (welfare) and Coasian economics in the context of planning theory, and gives examples from land-use planning. Webster suggests that Coasian bargaining may provide solutions to the problem of public goods provision.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;">
	Staley, Samuel and Lynn Scarlett. 1997. &quot;<a href="../../cms.mildredwarner.org/summaries/staley1997.html">Market Oriented Planning: Principles and Tools.</a>&quot; <city w:st="on">Los Angeles</city>: Reason Public Policy Institute. <a href="http://www.rppi.org/ps236.html">http://www.rppi.org/ps236.html</a></p>
<p style="margin-left: 80px;">
	The Reason Public Policy Institute promotes market solutions over government regulation. This article provides an example of Coasian bargaining with respect to land use planning. Staley and Scarlet propose changes to current planning processes, to streamline the development process and reduce transaction costs. They argue that in order to accommodate evolving societal land use needs, governments should use market based bargaining procedures that involve only direct stakeholders.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;">
	Williamson, Oliver 1999. &ldquo;<a href="../../cms.mildredwarner.org/summaries/williamson1999.html">Public and Private Bureaucracies: A Transaction Cost Economics Perspective</a>,&rdquo; <i>Journal of Law, Economics and Organization</i> 15(1):306-342.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 80px;">
	Williamson examines public bureaucracy through the lens of transaction cost economics, pointing out that public bureaucracy, like other modes of governance, is well suited to some transactions and poorly suited to others. Williamson claims that there is an efficient place for public bureaucracy, but that each type of governance (markets, hybrids, firms, regulation), has its own place.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;">
	Zerbe, Richard O. and Howard E. McCurdy. 1999. &quot;<a href="../../cms.mildredwarner.org/summaries/zerbeandmccurdy1999.html">The Failure of Market Failure,</a>&quot; <i>Journal of Policy Analysis and Management</i> 18(4):558-578. &nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 80px;">
	Zerbe and McCurdy argue that the case for eliminating market failure through the internalization of externalities is flawed, and that governments should intervene in the marketplace only when they have the ability to lower transaction costs</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;">
	Sclar, Elliot. 2000. &quot;<a href="../../cms.mildredwarner.org/summaries/sclar2000-5.html">All in the System: Organizational Theories and Public Contracting,</a>&quot; Chapter 5 of <i>You Don&rsquo;t Always Get What You Pay For: The Economics of Privatization.</i> <city w:st="on">Ithaca</city>, <state w:st="on">NY</state>: Cornell University Press. &nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 80px;">
	Sclar points out that public contracting is difficult and the transaction costs are often quite high.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px; ">
	Hahnel R and Sheeran KA. 2009. &quot;<a href="../../cms.mildredwarner.org/summaries/hahnelandsheeran2009.html">Misinterpreting the Coase Theorem</a>,&quot; <em>Journal of Economic Issues</em>. Vol 43. No 1. March. pp 215&ndash;238.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 80px;">
	The common interpretation of Coase theorem is that markets fail when property rights are poorly defined, and the way to combat this problem is to allow individuals to negotiate among themselves until they reach an ideal solution. This interpretation lends support to a conservative, pro-market view of polluter-victim situations.&nbsp;This article argues that this interpretation of the Coase theorem is essentially incorrect; in fact it misses some of the aspects that Ronald Coase considered key in formulating his idea. Several of his assumptions are ignored in the discourse.&nbsp;</p>

	<b>Theory - Political Economic Critiques</b></h3>
<p>
	<i>Privatization is not only about economics; it is also about politics. Political interest groups play a major role. Privatization also represents an overarching political agenda to alter the relationship between government and citizen. </i></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;">

<p style="margin-left: 80px;">
	The authors discuss the different political lenses through which privatization is viewed. They emphasize pragmatic privatization as a means of cost-cutting, tactical privatization as a way of rewarding allies, and systemic privatization to change institutional structures and societal ideologies. The article primarily focuses on systemic privatization.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;">

<p style="margin-left: 80px;">
	Henig traces the development of the theory and the practice of privatization in the United States until 1989-90. He argues that privatization is a new name for an old practice of government contracting. He points to the political nature of the privatization agenda and questions its long term viability.</p>

<p style="margin-left: 80px;">
	This article provides a theoretical critique of privatization and its potential effects on justice, security, and citizenship. Starr also disputes two main arguments of privatization advocates: that with privatization 1) choice will increase and 2) costs will be reduced.</p>

	There has been great debate as to why public sector entities so often undervalue what a project will be worth long-term to a private buyer. Some indicate the public sector understands how asset valuation is done but fails to account for private sector desire to garner first mover advantage in a new market. Others think the public sector lacks the information and the means to control the underlying drivers of asset value. Ashton et al. take these hypotheses further. In this paper, they propose the structured financial techniques (specifically debt swaps, sweeps, and raising internal valuations) used by private investors alter revenue estimates favorably for investors and lead to bid inflation. The research suggests a presence of informational asymmetries and structural power imbalances within the bargaining context. The authors use the examples of the Chicago Skyway and parking meter privatization to show how this happens in real-world situations.Regional Differences</p>

	Despite two decades of experience with privatization, US local government use of contracting in public service delivery remains relatively flat. Market approaches to public goods provision emphasize the competitive state, and attribute limited degree of privatization to bureaucratic resistance. Rural development theory emphasizes the uneven impact of market solutions in rural communities. Using national data on US local government service delivery from 1992 and 1997, we analyze differences in local government service-delivery patterns by metropolitan status. Discriminant analysis suggested that structural features of markets are more important than the managerial capacity of government leaders in explaining lower rates of privatization among rural governments. These structural constraints limit the applicability of competitive approaches to local government service delivery. Our results suggest that cooperation, as an alternative to privatization at the local level and as a source of redistributive aid at the state level, may provide a more equitable alternative for disadvantaged rural communities.</p>

	<em>Labor</em></p>
<p>
	Another major issue is the impact of privatization on job security and employment. Proponents claim that public sector workers are not harmed by privatization. Displaced workers can be hired by contractors or transferred to other government positions. Organized labor, however, is very concerned about layoffs, erosion of wages and benefits, and decreased levels of union membership with privatization. Empirical studies show that privatization has not had a major impact on wages and working conditions (Pendleton 1997), but it can have significant effects on labor relations (Hebdon 1995). Opponents present case studies that show public sector employees can provide more efficient alternatives to privatization (Sclar 1997). The expertise and experience of many government employees may make them better at providing government services, and management techniques like total quality management are making the public sector more efficient.</p>

There is some concern in the governance community that these changes may lead to federal preemption of traditional powers reserved to states and localities.</p>

	This paper describes the new governance features of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) and illustrates how they work out at the national, subnational and local scales using cases from the United States and Mexico. The authors show how NAFTA&rsquo;s governance structure is undermining subnational and local government authority in legislative and judicial arenas.</p>

<p style="margin-left: 40px;">
	This paper outlines the interest group or the &lsquo;capture&rsquo; theory of government: the same behavioral assumptions of maximization of self-interest that explain decision-making of the market can be used to explain the behavior of public policy makers.</p>

<p style="margin-left: 40px;">
	In this book, Graham examines the use of markets to increase the efficiency of the public sector. She uses case studies of Chile, Peru, Bolivia, Czech Republic and Zambia to assert that private market incentives such as competition and choice strengthen participation and improve performance.</p>

	New Zealand&rsquo;s government agencies are run by independent public managers who contract out most services and are monitored for accountability. Schick&rsquo;s article looks at New Zealand&rsquo;s system, both the benefits and cost, and finds reason that this system would not work for developing countries with large informal economies.</p>

<p style="margin-left: 40px;">
	In this article, Wirth challenges the idea that privatization occurs only when public sector responsibilities are shifted to private providers. He advocates a cost-benefit analysis that includes social and environmental externality costs and claims that local government officials should be accountable for both the decisions they choose to take and the one they refuse to make.</p>

<p style="margin-left: 40px; ">
	Governments in developing countries have adopted public-private partnerships (PPPs) approach where partnerships between communities and private sector are mediated by the government to take advantage of/ overcome shortcomings of both market and community based approaches.&nbsp;Miraftab argues that the inequitable outcomes resulting from PPPs cannot be solved by focusing on their technical planning and execution aspects alone. The larger policy context determines the state&rsquo;s will and capacity to intervene with a redistributive agenda and steer the partnership towards equity by building capacities of individual partners, especially the grassroots. In addition to elite interests and macro-level policies, strong social movements also have potential to pressurize the state to play an effective regulatory role. In the absence of state intervention, PPPs might fail to serve the interests of the disadvantaged.</p>

<p style="margin-left: 40px; ">
	Miraftab uses South Africa&rsquo;s Western Cape Anti-Eviction Campaign as a lens through which to examine two current issues of concern to planning scholars:&nbsp; 1) what the implications for radical planning may be of what she calls &ldquo;grassroots insurgent citizenship&rdquo;; and, 2) whether conventional planning theory, which &ldquo;universalizes the metropole,&rdquo; can be de-&ldquo;colonized.&rdquo; &nbsp;</p>

<p style="margin-left: 40px;">
	Cities are comprised of a complex web of interwoven infrastructure systems that structure social, economic, and environmental interactions. Graham and Marvin dissect the theoretical concepts surrounding these systems, their historical composition, and their resultant social and economic effects. The authors also present a series of case studies that illustrate the continuing unbundling of these networks in practice.</p>

<p style="margin-left: 40px; ">
	Clifton explores the relationship between domestic liberalization policies and incumbent (i.e. large companies with dominant market shares) internationalization for telecommunications and electricity multinationals in Europe.&nbsp; Liberalization policies encouraged by the European Commission have corresponded with many domestic incumbents becoming dominant multinational corporations. However, the exact relationship between liberalization and internationalization remains disputed.</p>

<p style="margin-left: 40px; ">
	Ramamurti states that he shares theWorld Bank&rsquo;s belief that &ldquo;privatization is a powerful and positive idea.&rdquo; However, in this 1999 article, he responds to and systematically dismantles the arguments of a 1995 World Bank study entitled <em>Bureaucrats in Business</em>, which laments the continued prevalence of State Owned Enterprises (SOEs).</p>

<p style="margin-left: 40px; ">
	Florio challenges the dominant paradigm that liberalization of network industries in Europe in the last two decades has produced socially efficient outcomes by posing three research questions: (1) whether ownership matters for pricing and social welfare; (2) whether vertical disintegration is a condition for obtaining competitive prices; and (3) whether competition actually leads to lower prices to consumers. The author addresses these questions by assessing (a) the results of liberalization in telecommunication, electricity, and natural gas, and (b) consumers&rsquo; perception concerning quality and affordability of these services.</p>
