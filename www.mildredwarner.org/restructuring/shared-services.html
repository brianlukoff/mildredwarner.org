	<strong>Introduction</strong>: Intermunicipal Cooperation and Shared Services offer an alternative to address the political fragmentation in US local government.&nbsp;Intermunicipal cooperation&nbsp;may be defined as an arrangement between two or more governments for accomplishing common goals, providing a service, or solving a mutual problem. It is one of the most useful strategies for achieving efficient and effective service delivery. Nationally, it is a more popular form of service restructuring than privatization. Shared services involves cooperation across jurisdictions for a common service. Transportation authorities or water and sewer districts are common examples. The challenge of shared services however is their single service focus and the inability to address multi-functional coordination challenges. This page highlights the relevant literature on several aspects of intermunicipal cooperation, with links to more in-depth summaries.&nbsp;</p>

	Warner, M.E. and Hefetz, A. 2012. &nbsp;&quot;<a href="../../cms.mildredwarner.org/p/199.html">Privatization and intermunicipal contracting: the US local government experience 1992-2007,</a>&quot;&nbsp;Environment and Planning C: Government and Policy&nbsp;30: 675-692.</p>
<ul>
	<li>
		Local government scholars are giving increasing attention to market solutions to urban service delivery. Intermunicipal contracting and privatization are two market approaches to reaching economies of scale. Using national data on over one thousand municipalities from across the United States for the 1992&ndash;2007 period, we explore the differences between intermunicipal contracting and privatization and assess how the use of these market approaches relates to efficiency, scale, and public engagement factors. Using probit models for each of four survey years (1992, 1997, 2002, 2007), we find these market solutions are only partial responses to the problem of regional coordination and exhibit important differences with respect to place, management, and political concerns. These market solutions exhibit limited efficiency, equity, and voice benefits.</li>

<ul>
	<li>
		Austerity and fiscal crisis make the search for cost saving reforms in local government more critical.&nbsp;While cost savings from privatization have frequently proven ephemeral, inter-municipal cooperation&nbsp;has been a relatively understudied reform. We analyze the literature on cost savings under cooperation&nbsp;and find savings are dependent on (1) the cost structure of public services, particularly those related to&nbsp;scale and density economies and externalities, (2) the structure of local government (size, metropolitan&nbsp;location, powers granted by the nation or regional state), and 3) the governance framework at the&nbsp;local/regional scale where cooperation varies from informal to formal. European studies give more&nbsp;emphasis to cost savings, while US studies focus on coordination concerns arising from the higher&nbsp;degree of devolution in the US local government system.</li>

<ul>
	<li>

The number of special districts has increased remarkably in the past several decades, and this article is an attempt at explaining the motivations behind district use.</li>

		Using national data on local government service delivery from 1992 and 1997, this article assesses the distribution of privatization and inter-municipal cooperation across localities in the metropolitan region and finds them most common among suburbs that also exhibit high income and low poverty. Thus, market solutions appear to reflect the inequality among municipalities in the metropolitan region.</li>

<ul>
	<li>
		In this article, the authors identify and measure key structural characteristics of &quot;fragmented&quot; metro areas, employing a comparative study of two metropolitan city-counties: St. Louis City and County, MO, and Allegheny County (Pittsburgh), PA. They introduce a conceptual tool for measurement of production structure (horizontal versus vertical nature of service, and integration versus differentiation of governments).</li>

AGES Staff Report 9403. Washington, DC: USDA, ERS. &nbsp;</p>
<ul>
	<li>
		Cigler argues that intergovernmental collaboration can build the capacity of rural local governments, which often lack the necessary resources and expertise to adequately provide government services and conduct policy decision-making activities. However, &quot;truly collaborative ventures&quot; are system changing, and thus potentially threatening to existing government entities. She describes the conditions are necessary to get positive results from collaboration.</li>

<ul>
	<li>
		The author distinguishes provision from production. &quot;Provision&quot; refers to collective choices that determine goals, standards, and arrangement for service, whereas &quot;production&quot; means the more technical process of transforming inputs into outputs. Oakerson demonstrates the options linking provision with production: self-production, coordinated production, joint production, intergovernmental contracting, private contracting, franchising, and vouchering. Among these options, intergovernmental contracting and private contracting are the most widely practiced in the United States.</li>

Washington, DC: USDA, ERS. &nbsp;</p>
<ul>
	<li>
		Jansen defines four types of intergovernmental relationships by means of local capacity (having the institutions necessary to deal with information) and centrality (having organizational linkages with the political and economical center of decision making). The author argues that when both centrality and local capacity are higher or both are absent, the relationship is stable. When there is a disparity between levels of centrality and local capacity, however, a region will seek to equalize the force.</li>

<ul>
	<li>
		Theorists have developed various models for government service assignment, which include criteria such as polycentricity/decentralization, federation/consolidation. These models all have supporters who claim their various merits based on the criteria of efficiency, equity, public satisfaction with service, and so on. Empirical findings show that no model appears to be completely effective or without deficiencies.</li>

	Accountability Issues</h3>
<p>
	Concerns about how intergovernmental arrangements can ensure accountability and equity.</p>
<p>
	Perlman, Ellen. 1993. &quot;<a href="../../cms.mildredwarner.org/summaries/perlman1993.html">Secretive Governing: Authorities proliferate; So Does Possible Misconduct.</a>&quot;&nbsp;<em>City and State</em>. March 1, pp. 9-11. &nbsp;</p>
<ul>
	<li>
		This article notes that the number of special intergovernmental districts increased by 12% between 1987 and 1992. The author cites several reasons why legislative bodies choose to create special districts: 1) they are a way of skirting state constitutional limits on taxation, spending, and borrowing. 2) they enable state and local governments to appear to be cutting their budgets while continuing to ensure service provision 3) they are a tools for intergovernmental collaboration cutting across political boundaries to meet regional needs. However, due to the lack of direct public accountability, there is a high possibility of abuse such as nepotism, overpricing, and mismanagement.</li>

<ul>
	<li>
		After evaluating many types of intergovernmental cooperation in terms of authority, efficiency, equity, and accountability, this article suggests that comprehensive reforms to existing local governments--federation, city-county consolidation, and urban county--provide an effective strategy in the area of accountability, equity and authority. Patchwork strategies--intergovernmental service agreements, functional transfers, and multipurpose areawide districts--are less effective in the area of equity and accountability.</li>

<ul>
	<li>
		This article introduces the legal structure and processing to facilitate cooperation, consolidation among local government entities in U.S. and a few foreign countries. The authors suggest that in order to enforce the changes more efficiently and effectively, some special preparations must be required such as giving voters a periodic opportunity to express their desire to study options.</li>

<ul>
	<li>
		This article discusses possible reasons for considering formal intergovernmental cooperation and presents practical and legal considerations. The author points out that the desirability of cooperative efforts among governments depends on economies of scale, convenience of performing the task, distribution of natural resources, surplus physical facilities, and the need for duplication of services. In addition, the author addresses legal information needed for two types of formal cooperative agreements: service agreements and joint agreements.</li>

<ul>
	<li>
		In New York State, local governments have the power to cooperatively provide any facility or service they provide individually. However, actual annexation or consolidation of units of government is more difficult. The New York State legislature is limited by the Home Rule Amendment, which prevents the state legislature from make laws for annexation without the consent of voters of the affected local governments. This article discusses under what conditions the New York State legislature is limited by the Home Rule Amendment.</li>

	<li>
		In this study of intermunicipal cooperation, the Office of the New York State Comptroller has provided a wealth of information, ranging from guiding legal principles to general agreement guidelines, that could facilitate a practical solution for governments seeking to improve the delivery of their services. This paper provides several pieces of advice on how best to determine whether a particular activity is suitable for intermunicipal cooperation. For example, a cost negotiation and comparison is suggested to determine whether intermunicipal cooperation could improve an activity&#39;s efficiency and effectiveness.</li>

Short believes that the role of the purchasing manager is central to the success of contracting services, so there is a crucial need for purchasing managers to examine established process of purchasing and contracting and to see where there is opportunity for improvement and innovation.</li>
