    <p class="shaded">
	<strong>Introduction:</strong> Sparked by privatization and business-model prescriptions for government, a debate has emerged as to the primary responsibilities of public managers. There are those who see public administration as akin to a business&mdash;providing a choice of services to citizens, at the lowest possible cost. Others believe that public management&rsquo;s responsibilities extend beyond this, to the preservation of public values such as equity, accountability and citizen voice. From this debate stem questions about the nature of citizenship, and the proper relationship between a democratic government and its citizens.</p>
<h3 class="section-header">
	The New Public Management</h3>
<p>
	<em>The New Public Management&nbsp;is a concept articulated by David Osborne and Ted Gaebler in their 1992 book,&nbsp;<u>Reinventing Government</u>. It applies the business customer service model to government. Citizens are seen as customers and the administrative role is streamlined by converting policy alternatives into market choices. This approach focuses on results and promotes competition inside and outside government. We highlight the debate and recent empirical research.</em></p>

<ul>
	<li>
		Following the emergence of the New Public Management model in the late 20th Century, Warner argues that governments are now seeking a more balanced approach to public service provision by incorporating civic engagement as well as private market dynamics.</li>

<ul>

		The authors describe how ten new operating principles, many adapted from the private sector, can revamp the way government functions, providing numerous examples.</li>

<ul>
	<li>
		Schick outlines why developing countries need to first establish a formal public sector, a strong rule-based government, and an internal market as a foundation in order to successfully apply New Zealand&rsquo;s public management model.</li>

<ul>
	<li>
		Tore Sager argues that in neo-liberal societies planners are caught between divergent values of Communicative Planning Theory (CPT) and New Public Management (NPM). While the principles of CPT have informed the values and attitudes of many planners, NPM has transformed the public sector economically and politically.</li>

<h3 class="section-header">
	The New Public Service</h3>
<p>
	<em>The New Public Service&nbsp;is a reaction to the New Public Management. It focuses on the mission of government, and how to determine the collective pubic interest. The authors believe that there are considerations that should come before cost and efficiency, and that citizen participation should be a major factor in decisions. They see the role of the administrator as very complex: synthesizing the needs of citizens, interest groups, elected representatives, etc.</em></p>
<p>
	Denhardt, Janet and Robert Denhardt.&nbsp;<a href="../../cms.mildredwarner.org/summaries/denhardt2003.html">The New Public Service: Serving, Not Steering</a>.&nbsp;M.E. Sharpe, Armonk 2003. &nbsp;</p>
<ul>
	<li>
		In Janet and Robert Denhardt&rsquo;s 2003 book The New Public Service, the authors offer a synthesis of the ideas that are opposed to the New Public Management presented by Osborne and Gaebler. Their model for governance builds upon and expands the traditional role of the public administrator, which they call the Old Public Administration, and contrasts with the New Public Management.</li>
</ul>
<p>
	Denhardt, Robert B. and Janet Vinzant Denhardt (2000).&nbsp; <a href="../../cms.mildredwarner.org/summaries/denhardt2003.html">&quot;</a><a href="../../cms.mildredwarner.org/summaries/deleondenhardt2000.html">The New Public Service: Serving Rather than Steering.</a>&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>Public Administration Review&nbsp;</em>60(6):549-559. &nbsp;</p>
<ul>
	<li>
		The authors examine the theoretical basis of the reinvention movement, such as 1) its use of the market model, 2) its emphasis on customers, and 3) its glorification of entrepreneurial management, in the light of &ldquo;democratic governance,&rdquo; which especially emphasizes &ldquo;citizenship.&rdquo;</li>
</ul>
<p>
	Blanchard, Lloyd A., Charles C. Hinman, and Wilson Wong, 1997. &quot;<a href="../../cms.mildredwarner.org/summaries/blanchard1997.html">Market-Based Reforms in Government: Toward a Social Subcontract?</a>&quot;&nbsp;<em>Administration and Society</em>&nbsp;30(56) 483-512. &nbsp;</p>
<ul>
	<li>
		The authors employ the concept of the Social Contract to examine changes in government/market relations within the US context, historically. The article starts by defining the fundamental reciprocal relationship between governments and citizens and examines how this relationship is being changed due to government restructuring.</li>
</ul>
<p>
	Moore, M. H. (1995).&nbsp;Creating Public Value: Strategic Management in Government. Cambridge, MS: Harvard University Press.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
	<li>
		Moore&nbsp;sees the role of the public administrator as grounded in a clear sense of ethics and public mission&mdash;what he calls &ldquo;Public Value.&rdquo;&nbsp;Moore&nbsp;believes that citizens receive adequate opportunity to have their voices heard from the electoral process. Therefore, it is up to the administrators, using their professional ethics and sense of mission, to make substantive judgments as to what is valuable and effective.</li>
</ul>
<h3 class="section-header">
	Social Capital and Citizen Empowerment&nbsp;</h3>
<p>
	<em>Social Capital theories recognize the importance of norms and networks in determining social, political and economic relations. There can be a positive synergy between citizen participation and governmental effectiveness. This is why planners place so much attention on citizen participation.</em></p>
<p>
	Robert Putnam has popularized the concept of social capital in&nbsp;America.&nbsp;While Putnam focuses primarily on inter-personal relationships, Skocpol emphasized the role of government in encouraging the development of social capital. Their debate is chronicled in the articles below.</p>

<ul>
	<li>
		This paper looks at the role the state can play in building social capital. Three key factors: autonomy, linkage and returns on investment for both intermediaries and participating residents, are shown to affect social capital construction.</li>

<ul>
	<li>
		Frug presents his concerns over the Tiebout model of public choice and other scholars&rsquo; attempts to amend it. He responds to these individualistic and consumer-oriented city models with one of his own, the fortuitous association model.</li>

<ul>
	<li>
		The authors describe the Grants for Blocks program, which began in 1993 in Savannah, GA, as an example of a local government initiative to increase citizen involvement in the community. The program gives small grants to citizens for neighborhood improvement projects of their own design.</li>

<ul>
	<li>
		<p>
			Frug reconceives the subjectivity of cities according to postmodern thought and seeks to empower them for the purpose of greater democracy and heterogeneity in communities. Increased participation in decision-making and exposure to strange people and ideas will build strong, vibrant communities.&nbsp;</p>
